<p><b>Website:</b> <a href="http://www.trinity.dk">http://www.trinity.dk</a></p>
<p>The venue is a four-star award winning hotel and conference center in Fredericia in Southern Denmark, accomodating more than 150 attendents. The standards of accommodation and food (including special diets) are good, the levels of technical facilities and support are very good and yet the price level is fair for the country. The hotel is called Trinity because it was originally founded with a Christian worldview, and the staff is dedicated, helpful and kind.</p>
