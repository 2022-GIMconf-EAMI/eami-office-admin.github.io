<h4>Fee Structure</h4>
<p>For the fee structure of EAMI GIM 2022 conference, the local organisation committee finds it important that fees are affordable for all attendees, and that GIM therapists and -students from low-income countries are encouraged to participate, especially in todayâ€™s harsh economic conditions in Europe. To achieve this, all members of the local organising team are working in an honorary capacity, and being a non-profit organisation, we simply try to cover the costs in hosting this conference. 10 tickets are available at reduced price for students and participants from low-income countries, by the principle of firstcomers.<br>
You will find all fees listed in the registration process. Below is an overview for your convenience.  </p>
