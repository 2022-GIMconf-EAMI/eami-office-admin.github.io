<p>EAMI and the organizing team are happy to finally be able to invite to a live GIM conference – and we honor all the presenters at the EAMI online conference in 2020 who stepped in in the middle of the pandemic to create a fantastic day. To include the presenters who chose to wait for a live conference and to invite new presenters speaking on the music in GIM we continue with the same theme in 2022:</p>
<p>The conference will honor the spiritual qualities and affordances of music as the center of the GIM method, and the ways in which the music moves and transforms our body, emotions, mind, and spirit, changes our ways of being in relationships and as citizens. The urgency of living in a world facing the pandemic, global conflicts, gender and race-based violence, climate crisis, trauma and terror challenges us in both private life and on collective levels. How can the music empower GIM clients to find their path?</p>
<p>To develop the field of practice and theory in GIM, we would like the conference to contribute to a deeper understanding of <em>the power of music and how it works out in the GIM experience</em>. We hope to increase the clarity and comprehension when presenting the special role of music in GIM to new generations of students and clients as well as to clinical leaders and founders, helping GIM to grow and spread in the world.</p>
<p>The conference participants are asked to dive into many aspects and facets of the music experience of Guided Imagery and Music, Music and Imagery and other modifications. We would like all contributions to touch at the music itself. Also, philosophical and music psychological contributions are invited. The call for abstracts opens for original research, theoretical papers, roundtables, workshops, and posters.  </p>
<h5 id="focus-of-the-one-day-preconference-gim-and-trauma-healing">Focus of the one-day preconference: GIM and Trauma Healing</h5>
<p>We invite workshops and papers that relates to the adaptation of GIM for the stabilization and processing of trauma. Contributions focused on specific experiences and methods, related to bodily states and dissociation, and to different kinds of trauma are invited, as well as presentations related to self-care to avoid vicarious traumatization in the therapist.
All participants in the pre-conference are offered a workshop by Maria Wang (…), concerning how to avoid therapist vicarious traumatization <em>“Selfcare for the therapist working with traumatized clients”</em>.  </p>
<p><em><strong>Welcome to a conference brimming with music, dialogue and empowerment
of the growing GIM community!</strong></em></p>
